Indian Food Prediction Deep Learning CNN Model

In this project we have images of 5 different indian food dishes - Chai,Dhokla,Dosa,Jalebi and Naan. This Deep Learning image identification/classification model is designed on Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) concept. The goal is to be able to automatically identify/predict/classify an unknown indian food dish image using this AI model.

The basic procedures implemented to achieve the goals of this research are:

1. Image data collection
2. Split data in Train & Test(validation)
3. Modeling
4. Model accuracy evaluation
5. Measure loss value
6. Save the AI model
7. Test the model with random image data

a. Programming Language - Python

b. Libreary/Packages - Numpy,Pandas,MatPlotlib,Seaborn,Scikit-learn,Keras,Tensorflow

c. Algorithm - Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
