Indian Food Prediction Deep Learning CNN Model

In this project we have images of 5 different indian food dishes - Chai,Dhokla,Dosa,Jalebi and Naan. This Deep Learning image identification/classification model is designed on Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) concept. The goal is to be able to automatically identify/predict/classify an unknown indian food dish image using this AI model.
